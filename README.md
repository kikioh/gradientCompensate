A compensation scheme for gradient spillover in a parallel NMR probe

## Description
Parallel NMR detection enhances measurement throughput for high-throughput screening. However, local gradients in parallel detectors cause field spillover in adjacent channels,
leading to spin dephasing and signal loss. This study introduces a compensation scheme using optimized pulses to mitigate gradient-induced field inhomogeneity through coherence
locking. The proposed approach offers an effective solution for NMR probes with parallel, independently switchable gradient coils.
